# Multiple-Apps

Objective:

# Build to add folder's, Album's, Notepad's etc.

=> Steps to complete this project:
1. This project is fully based on html, css, javascript so pre-requirement of basic html, css and javascript.
2. In this, index.html for html, main.js for javascript and style.css for css files are present and setup of visual studio in your laptop.
3. HTML-Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
4. CSS-CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files, so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file. - Provide more attributes. CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
5. Javascript-An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
6. First divide the screen in four parts and then apply html:

   a. Header-In this section, buttons are given show that we can select and then add folder's, text-file's (Notepad) and Album's.
   
   b. Breadcrumb-A breadcrumb is a small text path, often located at the top of a page indicating where the user is on the site.For instance, the path to our page is         Home > d1 > d12 > f1 for Notepad. This breadcrumb trail immediately shows you where you are.
   
   c. Container-Div tags are used to style the webpage so that it look visually appealing for the users or audience of the website. using container-div in html will         make the website look more professional and attractive and therefore more people will want to explore your page. In this section, actions on folder's etc.
   
   d. App-This include's all the sections which were required to build a good app like as app-menu, app-title-bar, app-body etc. Template section were for control on         actions i.e. select the proper value for that class.
7. After html, let's discuss about javascript:
   
   a. Stored all selected query in different variable's and define an array as resources in which all the details of folder's, text-files etc were stored.
   
   b. Then after add event listener to all the events. Define functions like as addFolder, deleteFolder, renameFolder, saveToStotrage, viewFolder etc. and vice-versa         for album's and text-files. In all the functions, always remember to use suitable variables such that anyone can easily understand.
8. After javascript, let's discuss more about css:
   
   a. Used of css was to build the page in attractive by using:
      i. font-weight
      ii. border-radius
      iii. padding
      iv. margin
      v. transform
      vi. display
      vii. background-color
      viii. text-decoration
      ix. border
      x. cursor: pointer etc.
     
   b. For use of tags, we have to take care so that right things were being selected like as '#' was used for id, '.' was used for class etc.
